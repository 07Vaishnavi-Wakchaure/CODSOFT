#Task 1

A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists
Description-
A Python to-do list program is a simple application that helps users manage and prioritize their daily tasks. It typically allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks, as well as set deadlines or priorities for each task.The program usually stores tasks in basic Python data structures such as lists or dictionaries, and may include functions for adding, removing, and updating tasks based on user input. It may also have a user-friendly interface, such as a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) built with libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
Overall, a Python to-do list program allows users to easily organize their tasks and stay productive.


#Task 2

Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.Perform the calculation and display the result.
Description-
This Python script implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. The script defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, each performing their respective arithmetic operation on two input numbers.
2. The script prints out a menu of operations for the user to choose from: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
3. It prompts the user to enter their choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the operation they want to perform.
4. The script then prompts the user to input two numbers.
5. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function to perform the calculation and prints out the result.
6. If the user enters an invalid choice (i.e., not 1, 2, 3, or 4), the script prints "Invalid input".
This code provides a straightforward way for users to perform basic arithmetic calculations in the terminal by following simple prompts.
